# POP-A-CORN (Prediction of Positive Abundance Correlation-based Nutritional exchanges)

POP-A-CORN predicts nutritional exchanges from positively correlated ASVs (or other abundance metric)

GEMNAST-generated data utilised to generate the results presented in this thesis can be found within this folder. Files should be downloaded and saved in the same directory. 

An additional file with simplified AGORA reactions (monosaccharides that are released from complex carbohydrates extracellular degradation), designed for efficiency purposes, is also included.

Network files are required to run POP-A-CORN. Ruminococcaceae (R ) and Bacteroidaceae (B) network files with ASVs mapped to AGORA models are also provided in the 'Data files' folder. Refer to main manuscript for additional information about the generation of these files.

POP-A-CORN was written in the Python coding language and requires installation of the latest version of Python. A Python-compatible IDE is also recommended (e.g. PyCharm).

Please refer to in-script commentaries for additional details.
